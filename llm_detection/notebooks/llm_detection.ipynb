    "We notice the following important patterns:\n",
    "* The training F1-score remains at 100% irrespective of dataset size. This can be explained by the very low mean similarity scores between the generated and human texts. \n",
    "* The testing F1-score improves for a dataset of size up to 1100, at which point it oscillates around 95% testing F1-score\n",
    "* The convergence point of 100% testing score happens at approximately 7000 data points. However, we can be certain this is a very optimistic estimate for the reasons outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these patterns we can make two hypotheses for our problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 1: Our classifier has \"solved\" the underlying problem**. The extremely successful results shown here indicate that the classifier has modeled the actual distribution of the data, and can thus solve it with almost perfect accuracy in unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2: The training data do not represent the underlying problem**. In that case, the extremely successful results shown here are indicative of overfitting, where both training and test data feature a fundamentally different (and more easily solvable) distribution than real-life data. This is the most probable hypothesis, and can result from low-quality data and a non-representative sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the only way to know which hypothesis holds with any degree of certainty is to expose our trained classifier to unseen operational data which were collected with a different method from ours (different models, prompts)."
